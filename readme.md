===========

Initial Setup
-----------
1. Install using the command: npm install jdm-node-impact
2. Copy ImpactJS directories into impact_core (create if it doesn't already exist)
3. Run the command: npm start (you will see some output ending in "app listening on port 8080")
4. Open a web browser and browse to "http://localhost:8080/"
5. If you are starting with a fresh copy of impact, you will simply see a black square with the words "It Works!" inside
